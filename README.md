# Retarded Lua ASCII-Obfuscated
Its pretty shit, i don't actually recommend use it. Ofc it somehow "obfuscates" the code but everyone with more than 2 braincells can easily deobfuscate that.

(I recommend, only use that for learning purpose or some stuff)

## Included:
- obfuscator.lua-File which includes the "obfuscation" logic
- config.lua-File which is used for defining the code which will be obfuscated
- deobfuscate.lua-File which includes the "deobfuscating" logic
- fxmanifest.lua-File Self-explaining manifest file
