# Retarded Lua ASCII-Obfuscator
Its pretty shit, i don't actually recommend use it. Ofc it somehow "obfuscates" the code but everyone with more than 2 braincells can easily deobfuscate that.

(I recommend, only use that for learning purpose or some stuff)

## How does it work? (Obfuscate)
- Paste your lua code in the config.lua in the obfuscator file
- Run the script
- Open the "done.lua"

## How does it work? (Deobfuscate)
- Paste your file with the obfuscated code in the deobfuscator folder
- Run the script
- Deobfuscated code will now be printed in the console

## Included:
- obfuscator.lua-File which includes the "obfuscation" logic
- config.lua-File which is used for defining the code which will be obfuscated
- deobfuscate.lua-File which includes the "deobfuscating" logic
- fxmanifest.lua-File Self-explaining manifest file
